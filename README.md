# Collaborative Community Platform

## Problem Statement
In today's competitive academic landscape, students often face challenges in keeping pace with their studies. Many experience feelings of isolation, impacting both academic performance and mental well-being. There is a need for a platform that fosters collaboration, skill exchange, and networking among students and faculties within the university.

## Proposed Solution
Our project seeks to establish a collaborative community among students and faculties within our university through the development of a website. The platform will facilitate student interaction, skill exchange, hiring opportunities, and offline connections on campus. By fostering a collaborative culture, we aim to enrich the educational experience and promote a supportive campus environment.
